an email when scheduled movie is out (need an option to disable emails then)
help
tvshows change icons, add shceduled state
instead by imdb id - search by name
icons

 Wrong/not existing subtitles - no eng default
 subcenter

 - Stop searching in the middle of the search - Stuck everything! strange red line
 - Tracked TV shows - table looks bad

movies mark all as viewed

when tracked show becomes ended - notify somehow to the user in the ui? (so he can remove it manually) - dont remove it for him
   cuz maybe he still not downloaded some episode from that show with the rss

showlistdownloader runs tooo long - why?

when doing action shown session timeout dialog but when clickin tab redirected to login wothout message

what if shceduked an old movie but no hd torrent found - maybe will be scheduled for ever cuz there is no hd movie likae that....
if found a movie wonce with 2 torrents. later when adding this movie again to some user, maybe now there are more torrent and better - we will not download them..

search results  hover text too long
save all jobs run history not only the last one
make all tooltips be one line
sections to contain also the body - refactor

movies:
  handle the case of a movie not out yet: Iron Man: Rise of Technovore (Video 2013) then there are no viewers yet and no point printing the warning
  8,223 [WARN ] MoviesTorrentEntriesDownloader - Failed retrieving number of viewers for 'Devils of War (2013)':
  movie with old year - scheduled as future but never will be - if there are no torrents for that mvie
  movie preview - make css download pass through server so it can change icon urls, but dont store the css itself - cache it per server load
shows:
  about your schedule in the site i think it would be better user experience if the user could choose time zone for the series release.
  add kickass torrents parser and add it to torrentz parsing like piratebay - to check need to be able to download how i met your mother s02.e03 and also brothers and sisters s01e03
  normalization in searchers makes problem in results removing & or and changes the results also grey's anatomy vs greys anatomy is a problem
    brothers & sisters vs brothers sisters vs brothers and sisters
  make episode disabled if season is empty and all disabled if no show name
general:
  out of memory - why?

when searching in torrentz, how to know that the result are what we need and not something else, need to verify somehow (house vs housewifes... the right season got back
    anatomy grey seaosn 8 vs s08 vs season 8 720p....)
    also partial seasons: Greys Anatomy Season 8 Episode 1-22

2013-04-17 19:54:36,655 [INFO ] ThePirateBayEpisodeTorrentSearcher - Removing 'Beverly Hills 90210 - Season 2' cuz a bad match for '90210 season 2'

Showtime House vs house
2013-04-17 19:54:02,377 [INFO ] CompositeTorrentSearcher - Found torrent "NCIS season 1" in thepiratebay.se
2013-04-17 19:54:02,384 [INFO ] TVShowsTorrentEntriesDownloader - Downloading "NCIS Season 1-9 HD" took 31890 millis. Found in thepiratebay.se

2013-04-17 19:53:24,400 [INFO ] ThePirateBayEpisodeTorrentSearcher - Removing 'How I Met Your Mother Season 07 720p' cuz a bad match for 'How I Met Your Mother season 7 720p'


episode matching:
case 1: single episode
  take everything before s01e01
  do LD on the texts
  future: take akas use country US and attr Short title and Alternate title
case 2: full season
  take everything before season 1
  take only when after season 1 there is text or number > 100
  also
  take everything before s01
  take only when after s01 there is space
  then
  take the higher peers between the 2 options

===== 'NCIS: Los Angeles season 1 720p - why not exist???
2013-04-19 11:35:05,888 [INFO ] TVShowsTorrentEntriesDownloader - [archmisha@gmail.com(1)] - Skipping request 'NCIS: Los Angeles season 1 720p' because no such episodes exist

when both jobs run the same time - one locks shows table and the other crashes cuz cant lock and timeout

if a show has ended and some user has it tracked - mark in the ui for him red alert

schedule - if some show has an episode in more than 7 days - maybe should add it too
schedule - if 7 days ahead have only 1 episode or no episdodes, maybe  better to display more days?


make subtitles be totally optional!

how to prevent when searching house from finding house of lies or house of cards
